            Process:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
            1. many customer begin with a content manager or off-the-shelf ecommerce solution like Wix and WordPress. We tend to scale these projects up, perform reviews and usability evaluations and advise on how to scale growth and increase sales or conversions.
            </li>
            <li></li>
            2. The normal development processes changes form project to project and is usually measured in months. It begins with brief and initial onboarding. After that we start mocking up a design led build or install core systems such as content managers depending on requirements. Its important that these requirements are made clear from the outset or result in delays.
            </li>
            <li>
            3. The structure of development depends on the scale of the team involved. Development environment range from local, development (remote) and staging. Local development is work done from ones own computer, in simple terms. Remote development is a domain hosted in a private area which should only really be used by development teams. Staging is an environment where content is tested and built, this is often in a state ready to be pushed live. Sometimes staging is not required and we use a live version or work with drafts. However on larger build, there may be a team or multiple agencies involved and we may need development environments set up prior to commencement.
            </li></ul>
            <p>
            Post-development phases include go-live production, testing, user testing, pluralistic user testing and conversion rate optimization.
            User testing is essentially from a usability point-of-view or from a technical performance point-of0view. this may include how the website copes under traffic and how it interacts with a large user base. During this post-production phase it may be necessary to update the search engine optimisation of the product. In cases with a content manager or content team, content may be rolled out at this phase. Conversion rate is how we optimise appearance, useability and search engine functionality to improve sales or lead generation, this is the conversion of a user interaction to a successful user journey.
