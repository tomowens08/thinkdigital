<h1>Ads Online</h1>
<p>
For all you advertising online services then look no further than our digital agency. We have breadth of experience in the general adverts online arena and would like to define such a term as essentially pay per click advertising, web delivery and social media advertising, al though, there are some other lesser used ones. 
</p><p>
Advertising online has largely replaced traditional media such as print and television or radio but the latter two still exist in a largely reformatted form to accommodate the web. 
</p><p>
Our sphere of influence can be categorizes as follows:</p><p>

1. Pay-per-click ads</p><p>
2. Google advertising</p><p>
3. Bing and peripheral search engines</p><p>
4. You tube and social</p><p>
5. Facebook ads</p><p>
6. twitter ads</p><p>
7. Instagram as an advertising medium</p><p>
8. Radio in the age of digital </p><p>
9. TV ads in the age of digital.</p><p>

Lets begin our explanation with a look at the largest and most dominate area of advertising online, pay per click.</p>

<h2>Pay-per-click</h2>
<p>
Pay per click essentially is the potentially very expensive area of paying for advertising on Google or Bing, mainly Google – by far, in an auction format. Its a Dutch auction like the stock market. So pricing can get out of hand, it is essential that you don't throw caution to the wind and assume that simply throwing money at this problem will work. Sometimes it, will but that depends on the competition in the market place for that industry or specifically, the keyword in question.
</p><p>
Lets begin my examining Google and it AdWords program as a kind of case study, the model is closely followed by competitors.
</p>
<h2>Google Advertising</h2>
<p>
Googles system is based on keywords, the phrases that people search for, based on the volume that people search that phrase, bidders will try to secure top page results for this. This position is not exclusively determined by cost per click bid. Any Google training program, such as AdWords fundamentals, will tell you that organic position play a art and of you bigger rivals have secured good natural SEO position, their rank will increase in a geometric fashion based on their bids. What is more, each ad will serve as  back link which , if you read up on SEO [ link to SEO page here] will increase the position of their naturally placed search engine entry, meaning leads through that point, the click through rate determined leads, are pushed to the website at no charge.
</p><p>
Much like building a rocket to the moon, its better to let the engine hum and see what results are like for the website, how the user engage with it and what bad links or black lists show up, even undesirable keyword positioning, when the website has the exposure of PPC. This is done and works like a warm up lap where the intention is not to break the bank. Never run a race-car without warming the tyres!
</p><p>
There are other search engines of course, more notable are Bing and Duckduckgo for example. Lets look at Bing now:
</p>
<h2>Bing and Peripheral search engines.</h2>
<p>
Bing uses a very similar platform as Google and inclusion is very important. One important consideration is that if your clients are company directors then know that many business uses Microsoft tech stack as standard. Its a testament to the survivalist nature of the company that they have lock down these clients through a mixture of MS server requirement and network installation defaults on Windows.
</p><p>
As a result you may consider some marketing through PPC on Bing especially on trial basis as its much cheaper, the click through rate is much higher and the cost per click lower, therefore to trade through the platform makes more sense even if the volume is much lower. Selling to the general public where volume is necessary may make this process virtually futile.
</p><p>
We can do a market analysis on the viability on the handful of other search engines.
</p><p>
Lets look at the related world of YouTube and social.
<p>
<h2>YouTube and Social</h2>
<p>
YouTube and social may offer you a chance to engage with the audience in a sticky way. This means that you can utilise the length of time a person spends on your web content by ensuring the statistically beneficial way in which a person is able to make a decision, after spending a longer time online on one piece of engagement will ensure a greater chance of conversion.
</p><p>
Video SEO. YouTube and other videos are displayed in the SERPs, so video optimization is becoming much more important – like using text overlays and closed captions, in addition to your description, title and file names. Check out this website's links to learn more about YouTube SEO.
