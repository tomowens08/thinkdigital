<h1>Trading History as a Digital Agency</h1>
<p>
We began as a freelance Flash designer and games design working as a Think Digital company. After this time it was owens-media and then idevinterative. Then after a short stint as a contractor I worked self employed on eBay. After this time and during I was NT media a dexterity f idevinteratcive.
</p><p>
Profile for our Lead and Principle Developer 
</p><p>
I am a 10 years veteran of the digital industry beginning as a Flash and front end developer after graduation in 2008. I immediately saw the need to self educate in to search engine optimisation. Over time I attended further courses and expanded my skill set. 
My work professionally leaned more towards the back end until I in later career moved back again to front end and SEO.
</p><p>
I am currently the IT Manager at OSO digital my role is to optimise the performance of the development team.
</p><p>
OSO What does it stand for?
</p><p>
Nothing, it can mean what ever you want it to mean.
A nod to form over function. The expression Oh So as in very much, presented as an acronym for design purposes. This is not a new idea but is rarely utilised. Therefore we decided to recreate it and popularise it through our selves, and why not? Ulysses S. Grant was a former president of the USA and history records that the S stood for nothing in particular but nothing less than the image prestige that was trying to be conveyed, by his parents it would seem. This is the oldest recording of the style as far as we can tell and what more credible source is there to replicate?
</p><p>
Then I began trading as THINK Digital.
