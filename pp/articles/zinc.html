    <h1>Zinc Supplements: Benefits and Uses</h1>

    <p>Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in numerous bodily functions, including immune support, wound healing, and maintaining healthy skin. Zinc supplements have become increasingly popular as a convenient way to ensure an adequate intake of this important nutrient.</p>

    <h2>What Is Zinc?</h2>
    <p>Zinc is a mineral that is crucial for various physiological processes in the human body. It is involved in enzyme function, DNA synthesis, immune response, and wound healing.

    <h2>Benefits and Uses of Zinc Supplements:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Immune Support:</strong> Zinc is known for its immune-boosting properties. It helps the body fight off infections and illnesses by supporting the production and function of white blood cells.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Wound Healing:</strong> Zinc is essential for the growth and repair of tissues. It plays a crucial role in wound healing and maintaining healthy skin.</li>
